# msp_lang and Interpeter
Simple and hackable programming language for learning about compiler design

![terminal image](https://github.com/manisaiprasad/msp_lang/blob/master/simple.gif)

This language was implemented in [golang](https://golang.org/), But you can pretty much understand the concepts behind, even if you never write a single line of code in go language

## Instructions to run on your local Machine 
Head over to https://golang.org/ and install 'go' on your system 

Then set your $GOPATH to the top-level folder 

or Base folder contains an `.envrc` file. If you have direnv (http://direnv.net/) installed then the $GOPATH should be
automatically set for you as soon as you `cd` into the msp_lang.

```
git clone https://github.com/manisaiprasad/msp_lang.git
cd msp_lang
```

To activate interpreter, Now you can run `make` 
or `go run ./src/msp_lang/main.go`


```
